_v r 2_ was made in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) (using [First Person Drifter](http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d) by [Ben Esposito](http://torahhorse.com/) with a couple of small edits) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). The sound effects you can&#8217;t hear were manipulated in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/). _v r 2_ is based in part on the work of [Gregor Schneider](http://www.gregor-schneider.de/) and in part on the work of Donald Judd, specifically his work “[100 untitled works in mill aluminum](https://www.chinati.org/collection/donaldjudd)” in Marfa, Texas.

_v r 2_ was covered by [AnaitGames](http://www.anaitgames.com/articulos/v-r-2) before it was even released! It has also featured on [Oujevipo](http://oujevipo.fr/general/5362-v-r-2/), [Kill Screen](https://killscreen.com/articles/v-r-2-tests-faith-pippin-barr/), [Warp Door](http://warpdoor.com/2016/06/10/v-r-2-pippin-barr/), and [over the net](http://overthenet.blogspot.ca/2016/06/hidden-truths.html).
